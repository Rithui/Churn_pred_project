Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Model
📋 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based churn prediction model for the telecom industry. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (discontinue service) based on various customer attributes and usage data. It uses backpropagation in a neural network to learn complex patterns from historical data and make accurate predictions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains detailed telecom customer information with 7,043 records and 21 features:

Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents

Service Information: Tenure, Phone Service, Internet Service type

Plan Details: Contract type, Payment method, Paperless billing

Financial Data: Monthly charges, Total charges

Additional Services: Online security, Tech support, Streaming services

🔧 Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Feature Engineering: Created meaningful input features and normalized numerical data

Deep Learning: Neural Network with backpropagation algorithm for pattern recognition

Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics

Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations for feature importance and model performance
